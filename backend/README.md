# Backend for Edvise

This is the backend service for the Edvise application. It provides APIs for managing assignments, file uploads, and other functionalities. The backend is built using Go and integrates with MongoDB and Google Cloud Storage.

##THIS IS A WIP
Currently CRUD is not fully implemented. Only Create and Uplaod works.
Other functions will be functional soon.
Backend can be tested using CURL
Example :
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "file=@your/file/path/testfile.pdf" \
-F "student_id=123" \
-F "title=Math Assignment" \
-F "description=Algebra Equations" \
http://localhost:8080/api/assignment/upload
   ```
